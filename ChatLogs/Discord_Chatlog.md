:wave:
so what genres have you looked at? I've started with idle games, but I'm completely stuck

MattmanF12 02/03/2019
Im looking at platformers, i'd say look at steam reviews when looking at idle game genres

Phixyn 02/03/2019
Yeah that's a good shout, thanks

MattmanF12 02/03/2019
You're welcome :)

Phixyn  02/05/2019
How detailed do you think the brief should be? A couple of sentences each section? :thinking:

MattmanF12 02/05/2019
I'd say go with a paragraph for each box

Phixyn 02/05/2019
alright

Phixyn 02/11/2019
For the prototype, do we want movement on input (when pressing A/D), or just continuous movement until death?

MattmanF12 02/11/2019
Continuous movement but we can test both

Phixyn 02/11/2019
Sounds good, I'll do some more work around block placement before I change movement

Prime 02/12/2019
Hey guys, I have come up with a sprint week postmortem template from Rob's project postmortem template. You can use it, if you think it is helpful

Phixyn  02/12/2019
cool, thanks :thumbsup:
should we upload these to github?

Prime 02/12/2019
I don't know, I did just to be sure

Phixyn 02/12/2019
yeah, I might make a folder for it in the repo

Prime 02/12/2019
ok

Phixyn 02/12/2019
I like your idea about the quick-time event placement, could be quite interesting
The block placement in my game prototype is so :poop: atm... I'm trying to make it playable at least but it's a struggle. Also there's no carts (yet :P)

(screenshot attached)

you can put down some sort of items at least

Prime 02/12/2019
It is a good start, you don't need to make everything work in the build until tomorrow, do as much as you can don't overwork yourself, that the point for the task to get a sense of how much we can do in a set amount of hours.  It does not have to be a cart for the moment, use any asset you have to test the game and the mechanics

Phixyn 02/12/2019
Yeah, I'm just gonna polish a few things while I work on my post-mortem

MattmanF12 02/12/2019
Im going to close the sprint for this week in half an hour, has everyone finished their tasks, if so then please move it to verify or done. See you guys tomorrow :)

Phixyn 02/19/2019
Spent all night yesterday trying to fix an issue in Blueprint... and fixed it tonight by adding just 1 delay node :yuliYada:
we have drag and drop into level now
should we close sprint tonight or tomorrow morning?

MattmanF12 02/19/2019
I will close the sprint at 11:50pm just so everyone has a chance to complete any task, if all the tasks are completed before then yeah i'll close it

Phixyn 02/19/2019
Sounds good
btw, should I move my tasks to Done or leave them in Verify?

MattmanF12 02/19/2019
You can move them to complete
@Prime if you have completed the tasks then could you move them to verify please :)

Prime 02/19/2019
OK

Phixyn 02/21/2019
Assets all re-organized and laid out neatly now :thumbsup:

@Phixyn Im trying to download the file for our game from Github but I can't find a way to download it, can you help with this issue?

Phixyn 02/26/2019
yeah sure
If you click "Clone or download" you can Download the ZIP file of the whole repo, which should be okay for now?
(screenshot attached)

or are you trying to use git desktop? :thinking:

MattmanF12 02/26/2019
Its okay I've got the zip file, thanks for the help :smiley:

Phixyn 02/26/2019
no worries - are you able to copy it into a USB stick/external, so we can go over uploading the changes tomorrow? It's going to be slightly different than uploading via Github
I mean, you can upload the files you changed individually via Github, but it's a bit of a pain and you can easily miss changes to certain files that Unreal likes to touch with no warning >_<

MattmanF12 02/26/2019
Once i make the changes, I'll save it on a USB stick and go through the changes tomorrow then upload it to Github

Phixyn 02/26/2019
Sounds good. Let me know if you need any help with Unreal, I'm happy to hop onto voice chat

This is what the Blueprint I showed you guys earlier looked like while I was working on it

Prime 03/04/2019
Hey guys, I made a draft for the pitch. Can you look over it and tell me if there is anything else to add or fix?

MattmanF12 03/04/2019
start off with the breif outline first, then we talk about our core game loop plus the mechanic we're changing, but most importantly we need a 60 second video showing our game, other than that the rest is good.

Prime 03/04/2019
Ok, I'll make the changes. I'll add the video to the presentation when is made

MattmanF12 03/04/2019
also later on today, is everyone free to discuss what slide each person should do for our pitch?

Prime 03/04/2019
sure, when and where?

Phixyn 03/04/2019
sure

MattmanF12 03/04/2019
7:00PM on discord?
Prime 03/04/2019
ok

Phixyn 03/04/2019
yeah that works for me
I'm working on adding stuff to the level to make the video
MattmanF12 03/04/2019
ok then awesome :smiley:

Phixyn 03/04/2019
also for the presentation, Rob mentioned in his email that we should talk about what kind of emotions we want from the player, etc

MattmanF12 03/04/2019
we could use the team brief sheet as well to say what possible feedback we could get from players

Phixyn 03/04/2019
yeah

Phixyn 03/04/2019
I can't hear anyone :frowning:

MattmanF12 03/04/2019
We can hear you

Phixyn 03/04/2019
I can't hear you guys if you're talking

Prime 03/04/2019
look in the setting for the headphones input maybe is the wrong one

So this is what I was trying to (badly) explain about the 3rd slide
the player will never not be on a rail track
would it be possible to change the image so that the player on one? @Prime 

Prime 03/04/2019
yeah, no problem

Phixyn 03/04/2019
or would be easier if I sent you an in-game screenshot?
might look weird with the background actually >_<

MineCart 1

I need to fix some issues and improve video quality, but do you guys think I'm on the right track?
I kinda suck at level design :worried:

Prime 03/05/2019
the gameplay looks good

Phixyn 03/05/2019
:thumbsup:

MattmanF12 03/05/2019
Yeah thats looks fine :ok_hand:

Phixyn 03/05/2019
do you guys think the character should be bigger or nah?

Prime 03/05/2019
The proportions look good

Phixyn 
MineCart 2 (scaled up)

I've added a few things and scaled the character up
But I think you're right, I'm gonna scale him back down

Prime 03/05/2019
don't do it if that means redoing the video, it's a small difference the gameplay is important

Phixyn 03/05/2019
nah it's fine, I also think the video seems laggy so I'm gonna re-do it :sweat_smile:

Prime 03/05/2019
ok

Phixyn 03/05/2019
is it choppy for you? I don't know why I'm dropping frames

Prime 03/05/2019
no, it looks fine on my end

Phixyn 03/05/2019
hmmm okay

Phixyn 03/05/2019
This is what I intend to use as a final version: https://youtu.be/otWon8BLhx8

Does it look okay? Anything that should be changed before I add it to the powerpoint?

Prime 03/05/2019
i think it's okay

:thumbsup:
don't forget to move your tasks on Jira btw :stuck_out_tongue:

Prime 03/05/2019
yeah got it

Phixyn 03/05/2019
Matthew I'll wait for you to review the video before I move mine to done.. I've put it on verify for now

MattmanF12 03/05/2019
Yeah that looks fine :ok_hand:

Phixyn 03/05/2019
Sick :thumbsup:

Phixyn 03/05/2019
Was the video demo slide meant to be after Project Brief or Game Loop? I forgot

MattmanF12 03/05/2019
After game loop

Phixyn 03/05/2019
cool, thanks

MattmanF12 03/06/2019
@Prime  we are in the other half of A214 for presentations

Prime 03/06/2019
ok, we start at 9:45, right?

MattmanF12 03/06/2019
We all need to be here before 9:45, presentations start at 10
Prime 03/06/2019
ok, wanted to be sure

MattmanF12 03/06/2019
Are at uni atm?
*Are you at uni atm?

Prime 03/06/2019
no

MattmanF12 03/06/2019
Are you able to come in now so we can go through the slides?

Prime 03/06/2019
sure
I'll be there soon

MattmanF12 03/06/2019
Kk then

Phixyn 03/06/2019
Oh I remember what I was gonna ask
was the Minecraft thing an intentional joke or did you actually say it by accident Matt? xD

MattmanF12 03/06/2019
Very much on accident XD sorry about that

Phixyn 03/06/2019
haha it's all good, I thought it was funny
does anyone remember what Chris said when I said minecarts couldn't jump? I didn't quite catch it

Prime 03/06/2019
he said instead of physical movement we used map interaction, basically repeating our answer to the question
i don't remember him saying anything about making changes to the jump replaced mechanic

Phixyn 03/06/2019
ah okay, makes sense
I think we've done well with the mechanic, the only other idea I had was what group 4 (?) had with moving parts of the level, which is also pretty cool
we just need to make the game challenging now

Prime 03/06/2019
yes

Phixyn 03/06/2019
@here meeting time \o/

Phixyn 03/13/2019
I've made the tasks on JIRA and started the sprint, but feel free to change them if anything is wrong
JIRA is still being very weird and slow, so probably best to wait till it's sorted. Took me ages just to add a description to one task :frowning:

Prime 03/13/2019
Ok

Prime 03/19/2019
Hey guys! Apart from the water and lava assets what else needs to be fixed?

MattmanF12 03/19/2019
Not sure what else needs to be fixed atm

Prime 03/19/2019
Ok, if you find anything later on you can tell me

MattmanF12 03/19/2019
Will do, just a heads up for tomorrow i will be leaving at 11am tomorrow cause i have to go to a funeral, is that gonna be ok with you guys?

Prime 03/19/2019
Sure, no problem

Phixyn 03/19/2019
Yeah, no worries
@Prime I actually haven't had issues with anything else, unless you  wanna make smoother wall textures
but I'm happy with what we've got at the moment

Prime 03/19/2019
If i have an idea what to do with it I will so far I think it will suffice
```

## 1st April - 8th April
_(No Discord activity between 19th March and 1st April)_

```
Phixyn 04/01/2019
hey guys, how long roughly did we want the walkthrough video to be?
cause my plan was basically to record the existing demo level (with some of the new assets/gameplay) and a few seconds of the random generated level
but that's not a lot :GWchadThinkeyes:

MattmanF12 04/01/2019
Roughly about 3 mins, that hopefully should be enough

Phixyn 04/01/2019
hmm okay.. yeah maybe if I "accidentally" game over early on in the level and then show the whole thing
so for the voice over it's just talking about the gameplay (keep in mind I will include the click-to-place change), etc and plans for improvements

MattmanF12 04/01/2019
Why not the whole thing rather than restarting midway through the video?

Phixyn 04/01/2019
yeah I was just thinking of ways to make it longer
we'll see if it does reach 3 minutes easily then there's no need for that I guess

MattmanF12 04/01/2019
Ok then see how long it lasts then

Prime 04/01/2019
3 minutes is fine, but i think the voice over should be done be one person. It feels unnecessary for two persons to speak, also it is difficult to make the voice over because I don't know what are you going to, or not to, talk about

MattmanF12 04/01/2019
Ok then should i write the script for the voiceover then?

Prime 04/01/2019
I'm okay with it, but if you need helpnor feedback tell me

Phixyn 04/02/2019
(screenshot attached)
Just found this old screenshot of the game
I don't even remember how I managed that

Prime 04/02/2019
that's unusual

MattmanF12 04/02/2019
How'd that happen? XD

Phixyn 04/02/2019
No idea lol

MattmanF12 04/02/2019
Thats it! Unfixable issue, this game is cancelled XD

Phixyn 04/02/2019
nah it's fine, can't reproduce the bug anymore
let's ship it

Phixyn 04/02/2019
@Prime you might need to bump up your task estimate on the animations task
if you're not going to be working on the voice over task

Prime 04/02/2019
I know, i'll do it

Phixyn 04/02/2019
unless we still want to mark the voice over task as complete
cool :thumbsup:

Phixyn 04/02/2019
The animations look really good btw

Prime 04/02/2019
thanks

Phixyn 04/02/2019
animated lava is hype :open_mouth:
it's starting to look like a real game

Prime 04/02/2019
hey, what do you guys think of changing my voiceover task to a feedback on voiceover and do it tomorrow when matt is done with it

Phixyn 04/02/2019
I think that's okay, only problem is we set the sprint to end today
so maybe Rob would complain about that

Phixyn 04/02/2019
(screenshot attached)
What do you guys think of the inventory? Should I make it smaller?

Prime 04/02/2019
looks good

MattmanF12 04/02/2019
That looks good
As for the voice over task for @Prime  i will delete it if thats ok

Prime 04/02/2019
yep that's fine

Phixyn 04/02/2019
(screenshot attached)
I added a tint to the selected one
We can always change it to a different asset later, but thought it'd be good to make it clear that we're selecting stuff in the video
also not sure about the tint color yet :smile:

MattmanF12 04/02/2019
That tint is fine, having a darker tint colour as highlight should be good

Phixyn 04/02/2019
yeah, I might make it slightly darker, idk
the game plays really well now I think

MattmanF12 04/02/2019
Im gonna close the sprint in a minute, any tasks that is left in process can be moved to done or put it in the backlog

Phixyn 04/02/2019
alright
done

Prime 04/03/2019
I will be a few minutes late

MattmanF12 04/03/2019
@Phixyn I've uploaded the voice overs on githib in the presentations folder

Phixyn 04/03/2019
Alright, I'm just ordering food then I'll start recording the videos
Shiet, I didn't actually change the game name to End of The Line
oh well, I don't think it shows it anywhere in-game. I'll just say it in the submission

Prime 04/03/2019
that's not such a big issues at the moment

Phixyn 04/03/2019
Will there be another voice over explaining the demo level once I record that?

Phixyn 04/03/2019
(screenshot attached)
that's not even intended but it looks cool

Prime 04/03/2019
yeah, but how did it happen?

Phixyn 04/03/2019
no idea xD But I want it in the video
uploading now

End Of The Line Walkthrough 1 - Demo Level

I had to slow the character down... the game was too difficult for me
Now I'll do 2 more clips of the randomly generated level: full-screen and then in Unreal's viewport so they can see the chunks being generated
(we don't have to use the last clip if we run out of time)

Prime 04/03/2019
ok, the video looks good

MattmanF12 04/03/2019
videos good

Phixyn 04/03/2019
are you adding more voice over stuff?

MattmanF12 04/03/2019
no thats it in terms of what I need to say, plus doing it and retaking each paragraph more than 20 times isn't fun XD

Phixyn 04/03/2019
Yeah, fair enough :stuck_out_tongue:
I'll have some food and finish putting it together then
any ideas about the one sentence we need to include about the  game in our submission?

MattmanF12 04/03/2019
Demo vid 1 for for the first demo and Demo vid 2 par 1 and 2 is for the RNG demo
and for the sentence we just need to say what mechanic we're changing and what we're changing it to

MattmanF12 04/03/2019
Hows the video coming along?

Phixyn 04/03/2019
(screenshot attached)
Almost there
there is a bit of a large "no commentary" gap though
wonder if I should cut off some of the demo level footage or something

MattmanF12 04/03/2019
If thats possible then do it
Sorry about it being short

Phixyn 04/03/2019
it's possible but it won't show the game over screen then :frowning:
nah that's fine

MattmanF12 04/03/2019
Cut the vid so it has displays the game over screen

Phixyn 04/03/2019
alright, so splice the demo level
I'll try that

MattmanF12 04/03/2019
Yeah if not then dw about it

Phixyn 04/03/2019
it's 2:10 without the splicing

MattmanF12 04/03/2019
The splicing shoudnt have much of an effect on the vid hopefully

Phixyn 04/03/2019
hmm I dunno I am awful at it :sweat_smile:

MattmanF12 04/03/2019
If it'll take long to do theb dw about, we've got 39 mins to submit it

Phixyn 04/03/2019
I've done it but it looks kinda awful, idk
jump cuts aren't my thing

MattmanF12 04/03/2019
Kk then leave the vid as it is, should start to submit it now then

Phixyn 04/03/2019
Sure? I was about to start exporting it with the splice
but it's 1:45 with the cut
so should I use the 2:10 version?

MattmanF12 04/03/2019
Hmm 2:10?

Phixyn 04/03/2019
exporting 2:10 now

Phixyn 04/03/2019
sentence: "A 2D platformer endless runner game with player movement mechanic replaced by placement of rail tracks in the level."

https://itch.io/jam/sumo-digital-uos/rate/400716
can you guys go over it and see if it's fine?
first time using itch.io and it's yelling at me a lot...
it kept saying I had no projects that I could submit and then it's not in the submission feed.. scaring me
but it's in the project list
dafuq

Prime 04/03/2019
40 min to download, well that's nice

Phixyn 04/03/2019
o.O
but the game page and everything is okay right?
ah there we go, it's in the feed now.. phew

Prime 04/03/2019
yeah it's fine

MattmanF12 04/03/2019
took me couple seonds to download the vid, from the looks of things, everything is fine

Prime 04/03/2019
well to be honest i'm also downloading borderlands goty enhanced
and it's eating a lot of download data

MattmanF12 04/03/2019
thats probably why its taking sooooooooooooo long XD

Phixyn 04/03/2019
sounds about right xD

Prime 04/03/2019
plus athena's wifi is awful

MattmanF12 04/03/2019
oh instant rip

Prime 04/03/2019
when it gets close to night time the download speed goes down to 1mb/s and i feel lifeless

MattmanF12 04/03/2019
well its subitted isn't it?

Phixyn 04/03/2019
yes

MattmanF12 04/03/2019
awesome

Phixyn 04/03/2019
The submission feed is suddenly filled with new submissions minutes before the deadline
we weren't the last ones xD

Prime 04/03/2019
when i looked there were about 5
that was a few minutes ago

MattmanF12 04/03/2019
XD had a feeling all the other groups would submit it at this time XD

The latest version of the game is on the master branch for playtesting
I forgot to say last night sorry

Prime Last Tuesday at 9:52 AM
Ok, I'll get some people to playtest it

Phixyn Last Tuesday at 9:53 AM
If you play in UE4 directly make sure you open the "MainMenu" level
Prime Last Tuesday at 9:53 AM
Ok

Phixyn Last Tuesday at 9:53 AM
In standalone mode it should start from the main menu

MattmanF12 Last Tuesday at 11:33 PM
hey guys, I will be closing the sprint soon, any work that needs to be done or task on jira must be moved now, this is our final sprint guys, well done for all the hard work but we've still got tomorrow to work on our game so lets make our game the best it can be :smiley:

Prime Last Tuesday at 11:35 PM
Ok, one question does the build have the click option cause what I got from github still has the drag and drop

MattmanF12 Last Tuesday at 11:35 PM
not sure, we'll check tomorrow

MattmanF12 Last Wednesday at 8:55 AM
Ok then i'll let rob know then

Prime Yesterday at 2:27 PM
have you made the folder where we can put the project postmortem?

Phixyn Yesterday at 2:28 PM
It'll be the "PostMortems" folder, I'll just move anything that starts with "Sprint..." to its own new folder

Prime Yesterday at 2:28 PM
ok

Phixyn Yesterday at 8:54 PM
Guys, I've submitted our game https://itch.io/jam/uos-group-project-1819-final-submissions/rate/420686

Prime Yesterday at 8:55 PM
awesome

Phixyn Yesterday at 8:55 PM
Unfortunately, I couldn't build a web playable version due to a known issue in UE4 and the PaperSprite plugin. The main level just would not play, all you could use was the main menu
I'll email Rob about it though, explaining the issue
Everyone who has web versions of the game used Unity :frowning:

Prime Yesterday at 8:56 PM
ok

MattmanF12 Yesterday at 8:57 PM
alright then, ah well least its submitted but yeah thats a bummer

Phixyn Yesterday at 8:57 PM
yeah, I spent the entire afternoon looking into it
I think I'll never use UE4 for 2D games again xD Had so many issues tbh
