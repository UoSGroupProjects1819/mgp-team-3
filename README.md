### Gameplay

End Of The Line is an 2D platformer endless runner game where you cannot jump to avoid obstacles. Instead, you must place rail tracks in the level in order to direct a minecart and collect gold.

To place a track, click on an existing track in the level. Your selected track will be connected to the track you clicked on. You can select different tracks with the number keys 1 - 4. The game ends when you collide with any walls or object in the world, or if you fall off the tracks.
